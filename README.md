# Calculate-Hotel-Occupancy-from-Text-File
This Python code reads and pulls data from a text file, calculates ‘Available [Hotel] Rooms’, ‘Gross Occupancy’, and ‘Net Occupancy’ and exports the original and newly calculated data as a formatted .csv file for Excel.  Original/given data in the text file is "Physical Rooms," "Out of Service Rooms," and "Occupied Rooms."
